		<h1>Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) Customer Agreement</h1>
  </div>
			</div>
			<div class="row-fluid secondary">
				  <div class="span12 content-module">
		<p><strong>(Consumer and Business Accounts)</strong></p>
		<p>To better serve You, We make available various Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) services, as noted below. This Electronic Funds Transfer Customer Agreement ("Agreement") informs You of your rights and liabilities if You currently, or in the future, use any of the EFT services available through State Farm Bank<sup>&reg;</sup>. This Agreement also advises You of your rights and liabilities in case of errors, discrepancies, or questions regarding EFTs on your account. There are three basic types of EFT services: Card Services; Pre-authorized Electronic Funds Transfer; and Electronic Transfer Services ("Transactions"). This Agreement sets forth the general and specific provisions applicable to all three basic types of Transactions described below.</p>
		<p><div><strong>I. Card Services</strong> are those services which allow You to access your accounts using a card at an Electronic Funds Transfer Terminal (Automated Teller Machines [ATMs] and point-of-sale machines).</div>
<div><strong>II. Pre-authorized Electronic Funds Transfer</strong> is any transfer of money performed by means of a computer or other electronic means that You authorize a third party in advance to make through the Bank.</div>
<div><strong>III. Electronic Transfer Services</strong> are those services which allow You to transfer between your accounts, to or from external accounts by use of a telephone, Internet, or other means of authorization. Wire transfers are not EFTs and are therefore covered separately under the Wire Transfer Customer Agreement.</div></p>
  </div>

		<h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>
		<p>THIS AGREEMENT is made by and between the CUSTOMER ("You") (whether one or more) and State Farm Bank ("Bank", "We" or "Us"). In consideration of the mutual promises and obligations in this Agreement, You and We agree, as follows:</p>

Your Savings Account may be linked to the same card as your Checking, Interest Checking, or Money Market Savings. Your State Farm Bank<sup>&reg;</sup> Visa<sup>&reg;</sup> CheckCard ("CheckCard") may be used to access your Checking, Interest Checking, or Health Savings Accounts as designated by You on your application or subsequent written request. A Savings Account may be tied with your Checking or Interest Checking account on the same card.</p>
		<p>
							<strong>ATM Card</strong>
						</p>

<br /></li>
<li>obtain balance information on accounts that the card is authorized to access
<br /></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You may make deposits at full-service ATM locations that participate in deposit sharing.

The actual availability of this function is determined by the institution which owns/operates the ATM.</li>
<li>At any merchant You may use funds in your Checking Account, Interest Checking Account, or Money Market Savings to purchase goods and services.</li>
<li>Savings Accounts may only be accessed through ATMs.</li>
</ul></p>

		<p>Provided funds are available in your account, You may use your State Farm Bank<sup>&reg;</sup> Visa<sup>&reg;</sup> CheckCard to perform the following:</p>
		<p><ul>
<li>At a merchant You may use funds in your Checking, Interest Checking, or Health Savings Accounts to purchase goods and services.</li>
<li>At an ATM You may:
<ul>

<br /></li>
<li>make transfers
<br /></li>
<li>obtain balance information on accounts that the card is authorized to access</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You may make deposits at full-service ATM locations that participate in deposit sharing. An ATM location participating in deposit sharing will allow customers from other banks to make deposits at that location. The actual availability of this function is determined by the institution which owns/operates the ATM.
<ul>
<li>Deposits to Health Savings Accounts made at an ATM will only apply as current year contributions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul></p>
		<p><strong>Fees</strong></p>
		<p>Charges for withdrawals, deposits, transfers, and balance inquiries are set by the Bank and are currently:</p>
		<p><ul>
<li>Free at State Farm Bank-owned ATMs (if available).</li>
<li>Free for point-of-sale Transactions.</li>
<li>When You use an ATM not owned by Us, You may be charged a fee by the ATM operator and You may be charged a fee for balance inquiry even if You do not complete a fund transfer.
<br /></li>
<li>State Farm Bank will not charge You for the use of ATMs not owned by the Bank (considered foreign ATMs). Further, the Bank will rebate a foreign ATM surcharge imposed by the ATM owner in any amount assessed against a State Farm Bank Checking, Interest Checking, or Money Market Savings account provided that there is a direct deposit via an Automated Clearing House (ACH) credit into that account during the statement cycle of the foreign ATM transaction. If your account is closed prior to the end of the statement cycle, the ATM Fee Rebate will NOT be provided for that statement cycle.</li>
<li>If there has been no direct deposit via an ACH credit into the State Farm Bank Checking, Interest Checking, or Money Market Savings account during the statement cycle, the Bank will rebate up to a total of $10 in foreign ATM surcharges per account per statement cycle. If your account is closed prior to the end of the statement cycle, the ATM Fee Rebate will NOT be provided for that statement cycle. State Farm Bank Savings and Health Savings Accounts will be rebated up to a total of $10 in foreign ATM surcharges per account per statement cycle. If your account is closed prior to the end of the statement cycle, the ATM Fee Rebate will NOT be provided for that statement cycle.
<br /></li>
<li>For International ATM Fees incurred traveling outside of the U.S., please call Us at 877-734-2265; callers who are hearing or speech impaired should dial 711 or use a preferred Telecommunications Relay Service, to have your rebate applied to your account. For those customers who receive up to $10 per statement cycle, the amount of the International ATM Fee Rebate will be deducted from your $10 benefit.</li>
<li>The Bank will impose a fee to non-State Farm Bank issued cards for withdrawing cash from a State Farm Bank ATM.
<br /></li>
<li>No annual fee for an ATM card.</li>
<li>No CheckCard or ATM card reissue fee for a lost card.</li>
</ul></p>
		<p>These fees may be changed from time to time at the discretion of the Bank, upon advance notice.</p>
		<p>
							<strong>Daily Withdrawal/Purchasing Limit</strong>. Your ability to withdraw funds via ATM or CheckCard is subject to the available balance of your account and the following limits:</p>

<ul>
<li>With the Health Savings CheckCard, it is your responsibility to make sure that your withdrawals are for expenses that are qualified medical expenses in order to qualify for tax excludability. You must also maintain records of your medical expenses sufficient to show that the distributions have been made exclusively for qualified medical expenses and that such distributions are, therefore, excludable from gross income.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul></p>
		<p>You may apply to have your daily withdrawal and/or purchase limit increased or decreased by providing written notice to Us at State Farm Bank, P.O. 2316, Bloomington, IL 61702-2316. Such modification, if approved, shall be effective not later than 10 days following receipt by Us. In no event will your daily withdrawal limit be less than $200 per day, subject to the availability of funds in your account. You may have your CheckCard limits lowered to $200 per day or your CheckCard privileges revoked at the discretion of the Bank.</p>
		<p><strong>Personal Identification Number</strong><strong>.</strong> Your State Farm Bank ATM Card may only be used with your Personal Identification Number ("PIN"), which is used to identify You as an authorized user of the card.

Also, if your statement shows transfers that You did not make, tell Us at once. If You do not tell Us within 60 days after the statement was mailed to You, You may not get back any money You lost after the 60 days if We can prove that We could have stopped someone from taking the money if You had told Us in time.</p>
		<p><strong>Internet Banking Liability</strong><strong>.</strong> (Applies to Consumer Deposit Accounts) If You believe your User Identification or Password has been lost, stolen or compromised, and You tell Us within two business days after You learn of the loss or theft, You will not be liable if someone used your User Identification or Password without your permission.

When a lost or stolen State Farm Bank<sup>&reg;</sup> Visa<sup>&reg;</sup> CheckCard is used at a non-Visa merchant, You will not be liable for unauthorized Transactions if You notify Us within two business days of discovering that your card is missing. If You do not provide Us with timely notification, the maximum liability You may incur is $500. Also, if your statement shows transfers that You did not make, tell Us at once. If You do not tell Us within 60 days after the statement was mailed to You, You may not get back any money You lost after the 60 days if We can prove that We could have stopped someone from taking the money if You had told Us in time.</p>
		<p>If special circumstances, such as extended travel or hospitalization, prevent You from notifying Us within the time periods specified above, the time periods will be extended to a reasonable time.</p>
		<p><strong>Gaming and Wagering Transactions</strong><strong>.</strong> The State Farm Bank<sup>&reg;</sup> Visa<sup>&reg;</sup> CheckCard is not to be used for any gaming or wagering Transactions, including Transactions for casino chips, bets, wagers, Internet gambling, or any other gaming or wagering Transaction. State Farm Bank reserves the right to decline Transactions for casino chips, bets, wagers, Internet gambling, or any other gaming or wagering Transaction.</p>
		<p><strong>Refusal to Honor Your Card; Refused Authorizations</strong><strong>.</strong> We will not be liable if any other bank, any ATM, or any seller or lessor of goods or services refuses to honor your card or retains your card when You attempt to use it. Even though You have available funds in your Account, We may fail or decline to authorize a particular Transaction due to operational difficulties or, at our discretion, for other reasons We deem to be appropriate.</p>
		<p><strong>Card Ownership and Cancellation</strong><strong>.</strong> You acknowledge that the ATM or CheckCard has been issued by, and remains the property of State Farm Bank, and may be revoked or canceled at any time without prior notice to You. You agree to surrender immediately your card(s) to Us upon demand. You may elect to cancel your card(s) at any time by surrendering and returning your card(s). Cancellation by You will not be effective until your card(s) is actually received by Us.</p>
		<p><strong>SAFETY PRECAUTIONS FOR ATM TERMINAL USAGE</strong></p>
		<p><ul>
<li>Have your card ready to use when You reach the ATM. Have all of your forms ready before You get to the ATM. Keep some extra forms in your car or at home for this purpose.</li>
<li>If You are not familiar with how to use an ATM, use machines close to or inside a financial institution or business until You become comfortable with using your card and can conduct your Transactions quickly and accurately.</li>
<li>If using an ATM in an isolated area, take someone else with You if possible. Have them watch from the car or nearby as You conduct your Transaction.</li>
<li>Do not use ATMs at night unless the area and machine are well lighted. If lights are out at an ATM location, go to a different location.</li>
<li>If someone else is using the machine You want to use, stand back or stay in your car until the machine is free.</li>
<li>Watch out for suspicious people lurking around ATMs, especially during times when few people are around.</li>
<li>When using the machine, stand so You block anyone else's view from behind.</li>
<li>If anything suspicious occurs when You are using a machine, cancel what You are doing and leave immediately. If going to your car, lock your doors.</li>
<li>Do not stand at the ATM counting cash. Check that You received the right amount later in a secure place, and then reconcile it with your receipt.</li>
<li>Keep your receipts and verify Transactions on your account statement. Report errors immediately. Do not leave receipts at an ATM location.</li>
<li>Report all crimes immediately to the operator of the ATM and/or to local law enforcement officials.</li>
</ul></p>
		<h3>Part II &mdash; Pre-Authorized Electronic Funds Transfer</h3>
		<p><strong>Types of Transfers</strong></p>
		<p>With proper written authorization, State Farm Bank can accept or make certain direct deposits, automatic or on-demand transfers or payments to or from your Savings, Money Market Savings, Checking, Interest Checking, or Health Savings Accounts. You may authorize a merchant or other payee to make a one-time electronic payment from your account to: (i) Pay for purchases; or (ii) Pay bills. For all funds transfers from your State Farm Bank account to another financial institution, the funds must be available in your account by 6:00 p.m. Central Time on the business day of the transfer. If sufficient funds are not available in your State Farm Bank account at the time of the verification, the transfer will not be processed. If a requested transfer occurs on a day We are not open, such as a Saturday, Sunday or Bank Holiday, the transfer will be processed on the next business day. Some of these services may not be available with certain merchants or employers. Federal regulations restrict the number of transfers that may be made from your Money Market Savings or Savings Account to a maximum of six pre-authorized, automatic, or telephone transfers per statement period. You are allowed unlimited withdrawals by ATM; by mail (payments directly to You or transfers of funds from your account to any of your loan accounts with Us); or by telephone (via check payable to You). Federal regulations require the Bank to monitor your compliance with these restrictions.</p>
		<p><strong>ACH Wholesale Credits subject to UCC 4A</strong></p>
		<p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Provisional Payment Disclosure</strong> - Credit given by Us to You with respect to an Automated Clearing House (ACH) credit entry is provisional until We receive final settlement for such entry through a Federal Reserve Bank. If We do not receive such final settlement, You are hereby notified and agree that We are entitled to a refund of the amount credited to You in connection with such entry, and the party making payment to You via such entry (e.g. the originator of the entry) shall not be deemed to have paid You in the amount of such entry.</li>
								<li><strong>Notice Disclosure</strong> - Under the operating rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, which are applicable to ACH transactions involving your account, We are not required to give next day notice to You of receipt of an ACH item and We will not do so. However, We will continue to notify You of the receipt of payments in the periodic statements We provide to You.</li>
								<li><strong>Choice of Law Disclosure</strong> - We may accept on your behalf payments to your account which have been transmitted through one or more Automated Clearing Houses (ACH) and which are not subject to the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and your rights and obligations with respect to such payments shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the state of New York as provided by the operating rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, which are applicable to ACH transactions involving your account.</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
		<p><strong>Liability for Data Accuracy</strong></p>
		<p>We shall not be responsible to You for any claims, damages, losses or expenses arising out of the preparation or delivery of data input for the Electronic Funds Transfers and credit or debit entries prepared by your employer or other person or company authorized by You to do so. The Bank is entitled to rely upon the accuracy and correctness of the data input prepared by your employer or other person or company authorized by You to do so, and the Bank is under no obligation to investigate or determine the accuracy of such data input or authorization of such entity to conduct the EFT.</p>

		<p>You will be able to verify transfers by the following means.</p>
		<p><ul>

<li><strong>Periodic Statements</strong>&nbsp;<strong>-</strong> You will receive a monthly account statement documenting the date, amount and description for each transfer.</li>
</ul></p>
		<p>
							<strong>Stop-Payment Procedure</strong>
						</p>
		<p>If You have told Us, in advance, to make automatic recurring payments out of your account, You can stop any of these payments by calling 877-SF4-BANK (877-734-2265); callers who are hearing or speech impaired should dial 711 or use a preferred Telecommunications Relay Service, or write to Us at P.O. Box 2316, Bloomington, IL 61702-2316. You must call or write in time for Us to receive your request at least three business days before the payment is scheduled to be made. If You call, We may require that You confirm your request in writing and deliver it within 14 days after You call.</p>
		<p>If You have requested another business or entity outside of State Farm Bank to initiate transfers from your State Farm Bank deposit account, You should contact them to revoke your authorization. If You have attempted to contact that business or entity, and have been unsuccessful, State Farm Bank can process the request.</p>
		<p>
							<strong>Notice of Varying Amounts</strong>
						</p>
		<p>If regular payments scheduled to be made from your account vary in amount, the Bank or person You are going to pay may tell You, 10 days before each payment when the payment will be made and how much it will be. You may choose instead to receive this notice only when the payment would differ by more than a certain amount from the previous payment, or when the amount would fall outside certain limits that You set.</p>
		<p>
							<strong>Liability for Failure to Stop Payment of Pre-authorized Transfer.</strong>
						</p>
		<p>If You properly order Us to stop a payment at least three business days before the transfer is scheduled and We do not do so, We will be liable for your actual direct losses or damages.</p>
		<h3>Part III &mdash; Electronic Transfer Services</h3>
