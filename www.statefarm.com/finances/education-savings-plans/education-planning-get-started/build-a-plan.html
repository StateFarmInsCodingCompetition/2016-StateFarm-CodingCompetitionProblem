							<strong>An investor should consider, before investing, whether the investor's or designated beneficiary's home state offers any state tax or other benefits that are only available for investments in such state's qualified tuition program.</strong>
						</p>
			<p>Earnings must be used to pay for qualified higher education expenses to be federally tax free. The earnings portion of a non-qualified withdrawal will be subject to ordinary income tax at the recipient's marginal rate and subject to a 10% penalty. State Farm does not provide tax advice. Please consult your tax advisor for specific information about your tax situation, including any state tax consequences of an investment. The availability of such tax or other benefits may be conditioned on meeting certain requirements.</p>
			<p>A $70,000 gift is viewed as an accelerated gift over five years. Any other gifts to the same beneficiary by the contributor in that tax year or in any of the succeeding four years may result in a federal gift-tax liability. If the contributor dies within the five-year period, a prorated portion of the contribution may be included in his or her taxable estate.</p>
			<p>Contributions can be made until the value or total amount of contributions across all Nebraska program accounts for the beneficiary reaches $360,000. Accounts in excess of this limit can continue to grow through investment earnings realized by the plan, but no additional contributions can be accepted above that limit. This limit is set by the Nebraska State Treasurer and is subject to change.</p>
			<p>The plan is intended to operate as a qualified tuition program, pursuant to section 529 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.</p>
			<p>Participation in the plan does not guarantee that contributions and the investment earnings, if any, will be adequate to cover future tuition and other higher education expenses, or that a beneficiary will be admitted to or permitted to continue to attend an eligible educational institution.</p>
			<p>This material is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities. Any offer to sell shares within the plan may only be made by the Enrollment Handbook and Participation Agreement relating to the plan.</p>
			<p>Neither the State of Nebraska, the Trust, the Nebraska State Treasurer, the Nebraska Investment Council, First National Bank of Omaha, Oppenheimer nor State Farm, nor any of their respective affiliates, directors, officers or agents shall have any debt or obligation to any contributor, any beneficiary or any other person as a result of the establishment of the plan, nor will these entities assume any risk or liability for mutual funds in which the plan invests.</p>
			<p>The State Farm College Savings Plan is subject to enrollment, maintenance, administrative and management fees and expenses.</p>
			<p>Investors in the plan do not hold shares of the underlying funds directly, but rather shares in a portfolio of the plan.</p>
			<p>The State Farm College Savings Plan (the "plan") is sponsored by the <strong>State of Nebraska and administered by the Nebraska State Treasurer</strong>. The plan is established in cooperation with State Farm VP Management Corp. ("State Farm"), the State of Nebraska, and OFI Private Investments Inc.
