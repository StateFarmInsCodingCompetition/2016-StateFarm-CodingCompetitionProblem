<h3> Description of Applicable Insurance Law</h3>
<p> Illinois Insurance Law 215 ILCS 5/355b, requires any company that issues, delivers, amends, or renews an individual or group policy of accident and health insurance to accommodate a reasonable request by a person covered by a policy issued by the company to receive communications of claim-related information from the company by alternative means or at alternative locations if the person clearly states that disclosure of all or part of the information could endanger the person. Or, a valid order of protection may be submitted along with an alternative address, telephone number or other contact information. If a child is a covered person, then the right established by this section may be asserted by the child's parent or guardian.</p>
<h3> Additional Information</h3>
<p> State Farm Insurance affiliates will accommodate a request made by a person covered by insurance to receive communications of claim-related information from State Farm at an alternative address or by an alternative means if such person clearly states that the disclosure of information could endanger himself or herself. If the covered person is a child, then the child's parent or legal guardian may make the request to State Farm. Except with the express consent of the person making the request, State Farm will not disclose to the policyholder or other person the:</p>
<p> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>address, telephone number, or any other personally identifying information of the covered person and any child residing with the covered person;</li>
                        <li>nature of the health care services provided to the covered person; or</li>
                        <li>name or address of the provider of the covered services to the covered person.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

<div class="span12"><h2> New Mexico Domestic Abuse Insurance Protection Act</h2>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row-fluid">
<div class="span12"><p> State Farm values your privacy and takes the protection of your information seriously. In New Mexico, the Domestic Abuse Insurance Protection Act (DAIPA) regulates the use of confidential abuse information by insurers.</p>
<p> This notice briefly explains the rights of a Domestic Abuse "protected person." State Farm provides an abbreviated and full version of the DAIPA. The abbreviated notice is below.</p>
<p> If you don't consider yourself a Domestic Abuse "protected person" under the law, no action is required.</p>
<p> If you want to designate yourself as a Domestic Abuse "protected person" under the law, please contact us. State Farm no longer considers all persons as protected by the DAIPA. We have procedures to protect you against illegal or unauthorized disclosure of "confidential abuse information." If you're a policyholder, contact your State Farm agent; if you're a claimant, contact your claim handler to designate yourself as a protected person. You will remain in this status until you cancel your request.</p>
<h2> Summary</h2>
<p> "Confidential abuse information" means information about acts of domestic abuse or abuse status. The term also includes the work or home address or telephone number of a victim of abuse and the relationship of persons closely involved with an abuse victim.</p>
<p> 
                    A "protected person" is a victim of domestic abuse AND one of the following:
                </p>
<p> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>named insured on a property or casualty policy (including auto or homeowner insurance);</li>
                        <li>principal insured on or certificate holder of a life, health or disability policy;</li>
                        <li>owner of a policy;</li>
                        <li>applicant for a policy; a claimant against a policy; a person seeking coverage under a policy subject to the DAIPA and its regulations;</li>
                        <li>person or entity providing shelter, advocacy, protection or counseling to victims of domestic abuse.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
<p> The DAIPA and its regulations do not restrict an insurance company's right to investigate claims. However, an insurer must protect certain information received during the investigation process. The "protected person" should know that confidential abuse information may be received from people other than the protected person. Also, a right of access and correction exists with respect to all confidential abuse information received by an insurer.</p>
<p> Under the DAIPA, the insurer is prohibited from using confidential abuse status to discriminate against the protected person by denying, refusing to issue, renew or re-issue, canceling or otherwise terminating a policy, restricting coverage benefits or charging a higher premium for a policy.</p>
<p> State Farm has always recognized our policyholders' right to privacy regardless of their abuse status. Our practice has been to protect information used to conduct the business of insurance and not to decline or modify insurance solely on the basis of domestic abuse. We will continue this procedure as we comply with the DAIPA.</p>

<div class="span12"><h2> Information with Respect to Victims of Domestic Violence and Endangered Individuals in the State of New York</h2>
<h3> Description of Applicable Insurance Law</h3>
<p> New York State Insurance Law &sect; 2612 and related regulations establish provisions for persons insured by an individual insurance policy issued to another person (the "policyholder") or a group insurance policy. This law and the related regulations place requirements on insurance companies, such as State Farm, when the insurance companies are provided with a valid Order of Protection against the policyholder or another person covered under a group insurance policy. For the duration of the Order of Protection, the insurance company is prohibited from disclosing the address and telephone number of the insured or of any person or entity providing services to the insured, to the policyholder or another person covered by a group insurance policy. If a child is the insured, this right may be asserted by the child's parent or legal guardian.</p>
<p> In addition, an insurer may not discriminate against a person solely because he or she has been a victim of domestic violence.</p>
<h3> Additional Information</h3>
<p> State Farm insurance affiliates will accommodate a request made by a person covered by insurance to receive communications of claim related information from State Farm at an alternative address or by an alternative means if such person clearly states that the disclosure of information could endanger himself or herself. If the covered person is a child, then the child's parent or legal guardian may make the request to State Farm. Except with the express consent of the person making the request, State Farm will be prohibited from disclosing to the policyholder or other person the:</p>
<p> 
					<ul>
<li>address, telephone number, or any other personally identifying information of the covered person and any child residing with the covered person;</li>
<li>nature of the health care services provided to the covered person; or</li>
<li>name or address of the provider of the covered services to the covered person.</li>
</ul>
				</p>
<h3> To Initiate or Revoke a Request</h3>
