Feedback for the coding competition?  Things you would like to see in future events? 

Liked the addition of using GitHub this time, it made submitting code very simple.  I imagine it would have helped sharing code between teammates as well, had anyone decided to work with me on this.  Thought the overall process of the competition went smoothly.
